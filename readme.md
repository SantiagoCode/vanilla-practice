# Window Communication âœ¨

This is a practice project, serving as an exploration of interesting concepts that I plan to delve into in the future.

## DescripciÃ³n ðŸ‘€

Using the basic Vite counter template, I built an app for bidirectional communication between windows. It utilizes a listener on the local storage to update the counter:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('storage', () => {
  setStorage.initialState()
})
```

The basic functionality is that whenever the counter value changes, it updates the local storage, and other windows are automatically refreshed by listening to the â€˜storageâ€™ event.
